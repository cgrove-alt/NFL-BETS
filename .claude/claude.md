first think through the problem, read through the code base for the relevant files, and write a todo.md
the plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
then, begin working on the todo items, marking them complete as you go
every step of the way just give me a high level explaination of what changes you made.
finally, add a review section to the todo.md rile with a summary of the changes you made and any relevant information
DO NOT BE LAZY, NEVER BE LAZY. IF THERE IS A BUG, FIND THE ROOT CAUSE AND FIX IT. NO TEMPORARY FIXES. NO SHORTCUTS
Always use the latest data
